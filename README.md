# Hello World

I'm Defensive Cybersecurity Engineer, CISO at Acensi Group and Author of Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist

## Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist  

Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist is an additional layer of protection containing a list of [IP addresses (version 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) whose activities have been detected as malicious.

This list is designed around the discipline of [Deceptive Security](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/be/blog/discover-deception-security#:~:text=What%20is%20deception%20security?,potentially%20demotivate%20some%20of%20them.) based on intelligent behavioral analysis of malicious activities related to cybercrime.

Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist contains the most recent data (IPv4 addresses) to provide an additional layer of security for your [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)), [WAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall), and [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) instances.
