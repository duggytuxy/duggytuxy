## Hi there 👋

I'm Senior Cyber Security Engineer and CISO @Acensi Group

## My Project 🧑‍🏫

My project is based on a Blocklist of malicious, aggressive, noisy IP addresses with strong signals, built around a deployment of a few probes placed in the French and Belgian network.

**This blocklist is maintained under the frequency of updates between 4 hours and 24 hours depending on the analytical processing and correlation between different CTI platforms.**
