## Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist  

Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist is an additional layer of protection containing a list of [IP addresses (version 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) whose activities have been detected as malicious.

This list is designed around the discipline of [Deceptive Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_technology) based on intelligent behavioral analysis of malicious activities related to cybercrime.
